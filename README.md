Note For Reviewer:
- Create cart API seems not working (Not creating a new cart). Unfortunately i have to skips it.

In case u wonder:
- Yes its kinda oversimplified.
- i'm using tanstack query integrated with openapi generator to provide type-safety to fetch call (i really care about DX)
- I have not uses Material UI so it feels really strange to me. I do be more familiar with tailwind/shadcn-ui combo.

Grazie!
